# Checking Test

Match a number to one of the 5 options. 50 questions. Designed for the dad as per request, who is doing a similar test soon. Good luck :pray:

There are so many things that could be improved here. The real test has the numbers go from 5 digits up to 10 digits, and has a time limit going from 10 seconds to 5. I could have designed an algorithm instead of hard-coding the questions and answers. However, due to the time constraint I made a simple version.
