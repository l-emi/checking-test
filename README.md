# Checking Test
### [Letters version here](https://l-emi.github.io/checking-test-letters/)

Match a number to one of the 5 options. 60 questions, and the digits of the number increase every 10 questions. Designed for the dad as per request, who is doing a similar test soon. Good luck :pray:

There are so many things that could be improved here. The real test has a time limit going from 10 seconds to 5. I could have designed an algorithm instead of hard-coding the questions and answers. However, due to the time constraint I made a simple version.
